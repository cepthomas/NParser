# NParser - simple roll your own parser.  

I have always meant to build one of these for odd jobs.
Code Project informed me about [Easier Hand Rolled Parsers](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1280230/Easier-Hand-Rolled-Parsers)
so I digested, then regurgitated, rinsed and repeated. So the basic structure and concepts are hers (CPOL) but most of it
is pretty much mine.

Json parser given as example.
